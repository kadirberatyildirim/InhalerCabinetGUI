# InhalerCabinetGUI
This repository contains python code written for a GUI for a research project. We have designed a cabinet for simulating smoking where 7 parameters are monitored (such as O, CO2, CO levels etc). I have used a raspberry pi model 3 b+ with raspbian as OS and written a systemd service to automatically start my python GUI. All functionality of the system can be controlled via said GUI, in addition to that, data can be visualized, saved and altered using only this GUI.

This project is completed and was presented in a conference. Conference paper link: https://openaccess.bezmialem.edu.tr/handle/20.500.12645/27417
